## Sneak peek

```dart
@Entity()
class Person {
  int id;

  String firstName;
  String lastName;

  Person({this.id = 0, required this.firstName, required this.lastName});
}

final store = await openStore(); 
final box = store.box<Person>();

var person = Person(firstName: 'Joe', lastName: 'Green');

final id = box.put(person);  // Create

person = box.get(id)!;       // Read

person.lastName = "Black";
box.put(person);             // Update

box.remove(person.id);       // Delete

// find all people whose name start with letter 'J'
final query = box.query(Person_.firstName.startsWith('J')).build();
final people = query.find();  // find() returns List<Person>
```

## Getting Started

**New:** check out our new [Getting Started guide](https://docs.objectbox.io/getting-started).

Depending on if you are building a Flutter or Dart-only app, follow the steps below to start using ObjectBox.

### Flutter 

Add these dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  objectbox: ^1.2.0
  objectbox_flutter_libs: any
  # for ObjectBox Sync use this dependency instead:
  # objectbox_sync_flutter_libs: any

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.0.0
  objectbox_generator: any
```

* Install the packages: `flutter pub get`
* **For iOS**: in the Flutter Runner Xcode project
  * increase the deployment target to at least iOS 11 and, 
  * under Architectures, replace `${ARCHS_STANDARD}` with `arm64` (or `$ARCHS_STANDARD_64_BIT`). See [FAQ](#faq) for details.
* **For sandboxed macOS apps**: specify an application group.
  Check all `macos/Runner/*.entitlements` files if they contain a `<dict>` section with correct group ID info. 
  Change the string value to the `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` found in Xcode settings, plus an application-specific suffix, for example: 
  
  ```xml
  <key>com.apple.security.application-groups</key>
  <array>
    <string>FGDTDLOBXDJ.demo</string>
  </array>
  ```
  
  Next, in the app code, pass the same string when opening the Store, for example: `openStore(macosApplicationGroup: 'FGDTDLOBXDJ.demo')`.  
  Note: Pick a short group identifier; there's an internal limit in macOS that requires the complete string to be 
  19 characters or fewer.
* **For Sync + Android**: in `android/app/build.gradle` set `minSdkVersion 21` in section `android -> defaultConfig`. 
* In order to run Flutter unit tests locally on your machine, install the native ObjectBox library on 
  your host machine (same as you would if you developed for Dart native, as described in the next section):

  ```shell script
  bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart/main/install.sh)
  ```

Continue with the [examples README](example/README.md) to learn how to create entities and use the ObjectBox API.

### Dart Native

Add these dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  objectbox: ^1.2.0

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.0.0
  objectbox_generator: any
```

* Install the packages: `dart pub get`
* Install [objectbox-c](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-c) system-wide (use "Git bash" on Windows):

  ```shell script
  bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart/main/install.sh)
  ```
  
  To install ObjectBox Sync variant of the native library, pass `--sync` argument to the script:
  
  ```shell script
  bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart/main/install.sh) --sync
  ```

Continue with the [examples README](example/README.md) to learn how to create entities and use the ObjectBox API.

to guide you and answer questions.

## FAQ

_**Q: Flutter iOS builds for armv7 fail with "ObjectBox does not contain that architecture", are 32-bit iOS devices supported?**_  
**A: Only 64-bit iOS devices are supported.** When ObjectBox was first released for iOS all the latest iOS devices had 64-bit support,
so we decided to not ship armv7 support.
To resolve the build error, configure Architectures in your Xcode project like described in [Getting Started - Flutter](#flutter).

_**Q: After adding ObjectBox, the size of the APK increased significantly. Why is that?**_  
**A: This is caused by ObjectBox following
the [official Android recommendations](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/reduce-apk-size#extract-false)
for library compression settings**. By default, Flutter apps created from the template have the compression enabled,
opposite to the recommendation. The setting to disable library compression affects all native libraries in your app, not
just ObjectBox - with Flutter native libraries now taking up the large portion of the increased APK size. ObjectBox
library adds about 5.8 MiB uncompressed, and Flutter framework libs increase the uncompressed size by 18.4 MiB.  
_Q: Should I be worried about the size increase of uncompressed libraries?_  
A: No, not really. Packaging uncompressed `.so` files is actually better for users. It uses less storage on device as it
avoids copying .so files from the APK to the filesystem during installation and has the added benefit of making updates
of your app smaller. For more information about the sizes, see the following table created with 
ObjectBox v0.14.0 and Flutter v2.0.5 release builds (using the [recommended](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android#build-an-apk)
`flutter build apk --split-per-abi` to build APKs for each ABI):

| Release                                   | without ObjectBox |            with ObjectBox |    difference |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------: | ------------------------: | ------------: |
| APK (default compressed, arm64-v8a)       |           5.5 MiB |       6.0 MiB<sup>1</sup> |      +0.5 MiB |
| APK (uncompressed, arm64-v8a)<sup>2</sup> |          12.0 MiB |                  13.5 MiB |  **+1.5 MiB** |
| Fat APK (uncompressed, all ABIs)          |          33.8 MiB |                  39.6 MiB |      +5.8 MiB |

<sup>1</sup> Requires turning compression back on: in the `<application>` tag in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` add
```
android:extractNativeLibs="true"
tools:replace="android:extractNativeLibs"
```
to override the ObjectBox settings.

<sup>2</sup> This is also about the size an APK generated by Google Play would be when uploading an App Bundle (`flutter build appbundle`).
