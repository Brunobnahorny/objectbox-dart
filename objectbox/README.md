ObjectBox Dart & Flutter
==========================

ObjectBox is a super-fast database storing Dart objects locally.

* üèÅ **High performance** - improving response rates and enabling real-time applications.
* ü™Ç **ACID compliance** - Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable.
* üîó **Relations** - object links / relationships are built-in.
* üå± **Scalable** - grows with your app, handling millions of objects with ease.
* üíê **Queries** - filter data as needed, even across relations.
* ü¶Æ **Statically typed** - compile time checks & optimizations.
* üíª **Multiplatform** - Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows.
* üìÉ **Schema migration** - change your model with confidence.
* üë• [**ObjectBox Sync**](https://objectbox.io/sync/) - keeps data in sync offline or online, between devices and servers.

## Sneak peek

```dart
@Entity()
class Person {
  int id;

  String firstName;
  String lastName;

  Person({this.id = 0, required this.firstName, required this.lastName});
}

// Note: in Flutter you also need to specify a directory, see examples.
final store = Store(getObjectBoxModel());
final box = store.box<Person>();

var person = Person(firstName: 'Joe', lastName: 'Green');

final id = box.put(person);  // Create

person = box.get(id)!;       // Read

person.lastName = "Black";
box.put(person);             // Update

box.remove(person.id);       // Delete

// find all people whose name start with letter 'J'
final query = box.query(Person_.firstName.startsWith('J')).build();
final people = query.find();  // find() returns List<Person>
```

Getting started
---------------

Add the following dependencies to start using ObjectBox and code generator.

### Flutter 

```yaml
dependencies:
  objectbox: ^0.15.0
  objectbox_flutter_libs: any

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^1.0.0
  objectbox_generator: any
```

* Install the packages: `flutter pub get`
* XCode/iOS only: increase the deployment target to iOS 11 and, under Architectures, replace `${ARCHS_STANDARD}` with `arm64` (or `$ARCHS_STANDARD_64_BIT`). See [FAQ](#faq) for details.
* Sync + Android only: in your `android/app/build.gradle` set `minSdkVersion 21` in section `android -> defaultConfig`. 

### Dart Native

```yaml
dependencies:
  objectbox: ^0.15.0

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.0.0
  objectbox_generator: any
```

* Install the packages: `dart pub get`
* Install [objectbox-c](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-c) system-wide (use "Git bash" on Windows):

  ```shell script
  bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart/main/install.sh)
  ```
  
  To install ObjectBox Sync variant of the native library, pass `--sync` argument to the script:
  
  ```shell script
  bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart/main/install.sh) --sync
  ```

Help wanted
-----------

ObjectBox Dart is still not on par with other language bindings where ObjectBox is available.
To bring all the missing features to Dart, we're asking the community to help out. PRs are more than welcome!
The ObjectBox team will try its best to guide you and answer questions.

### Feedback

Also, please let us know your feedback GitHub issues, either comment on an existing one or open a new one.
For example, if you experience errors or if you have ideas for how to improve the API.

FAQ
---

_**Q: After adding ObjectBox, the size of the APK increased significantly. Why is that?**_  
**A: This is caused by ObjectBox following
the [official Android recommendations](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/reduce-apk-size#extract-false)
for library compression settings**. By default, Flutter apps created from the template have the compression enabled,
opposite to the recommendation. The setting to disable library compression affects all native libraries in your app, not
just ObjectBox - with Flutter native libraries now taking up the large portion of the increased APK size. ObjectBox
library adds about 5.8 MiB uncompressed, and Flutter framework libs increase the uncompressed size by 18.4 MiB.  
_Q: Should I be worried about the size increase of uncompressed libraries?_  
A: No, not really. Packaging uncompressed `.so` files is actually better for users. It uses less storage on device as it
avoids copying .so files from the APK to the filesystem during installation and has the added benefit of making updates
of your app smaller. For more information about the sizes, see the following table created with 
ObjectBox v0.14.0 and Flutter v2.0.5 release builds (using the [recommended](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android#build-an-apk)
`flutter build apk --split-per-abi` to build APKs for each ABI):

| Release                                   | without ObjectBox |            with ObjectBox |    difference |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------: | ------------------------: | ------------: | 
| APK (default compressed, arm64-v8a)       |           5.5 MiB |       6.0 MiB<sup>1</sup> |      +0.5 MiB |
| APK (uncompressed, arm64-v8a)<sup>2</sup> |          12.0 MiB |                  13.5 MiB |  **+1.5 MiB** |
| Fat APK (uncompressed, all ABIs)          |          33.8 MiB |                  39.6 MiB |      +5.8 MiB |

<sup>1</sup> Requires turning compression back on: in the `<application>` tag in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` add
```
android:extractNativeLibs="true"
tools:replace="android:extractNativeLibs"
```
to override the ObjectBox settings.

<sup>2</sup> This is also about the size an APK generated by Google Play would be when uploading an App Bundle (`flutter build appbundle`).

_**Q: Flutter iOS builds for armv7 fail with "ObjectBox does not contain that architecture", does it not support 32-bit devices?**_  
**A: No, only 64-bit iOS devices are supported.** When ObjectBox was first released for iOS all the latest iOS devices had 64-bit support,
so we decided to not ship armv7 support. To resolve the build error, in your XCode project
look under Architectures and replace `${ARCHS_STANDARD)` with `arm64` (or `$ARCHS_STANDARD_64_BIT`).
