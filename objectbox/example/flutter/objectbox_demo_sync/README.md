# objectbox_demo

## Getting Started with ObjectBox Sync in Flutter / Dart

This project contains the Flutter version of the main example from the [objectbox-examples](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-examples) repository.

You need to have a Sync Trial and run the Sync Server to run the demo --> Apply for the [Sync Trial here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcpbVFqU1MdVo5p122sl8TzXSF8nH3WqmZg7iG0fCcSXtckQ/viewform).

Also, do check out the [Sync Docs](https://sync.objectbox.io/) and [general info on ObjectBox Sync](https://objectbox.io/sync/).
